🎨 Level Up! I’ve Learned CSS and Built a Styled Webpage 💻✨

I'm excited to share that I’ve completed my learning in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and used it to enhance the look and feel of a webpage I created! 🖌️📄

After learning HTML, diving into CSS opened up a whole new world of design, layout, and creativity. From color schemes and typography to flexbox layouts and hover effects—I explored how styling brings structure to life.

🛠️ What I built:

A fully styled personal webpage

Customized layout, fonts, buttons, and responsive design elements

This project taught me how crucial design is in delivering a better user experience. I’m now moving ahead to learn JavaScript to make my webpages interactive! 🔥

If you're also into frontend or just starting, I’d love to connect and learn together! 🚀
